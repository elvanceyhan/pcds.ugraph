\description{
An object of class \code{"NumEdges"}.
Returns the number of edges of
the underlying or reflexivity graph of
Central Similarity Proximity Catch Digraph (CS-PCD)
and various other quantities and vectors such as
the vector of number of vertices (i.e., number of data points)
in the Delaunay triangles,
number of data points in the convex hull of \code{Yp} points,
indices of the Delaunay triangles for the data points, etc.

CS proximity regions are defined with respect to the
Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points
with expansion parameter \eqn{t > 0}
and edge regions in each triangle
is based on the center \eqn{M=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}
in barycentric coordinates in the interior of each
Delaunay triangle (default for \eqn{M=(1,1,1)}
which is the center of mass of the triangle).
Each Delaunay triangle is first converted to
an (nonscaled) basic triangle so that \code{M} will be the same
type of center for each Delaunay triangle
(this conversion is not necessary when \code{M} is \eqn{CM}).

Convex hull of \code{Yp} is partitioned
by the Delaunay triangles based on \code{Yp} points
(i.e., multiple triangles are the set of these Delaunay triangles
whose union constitutes the
convex hull of \code{Yp} points).
For the number of edges,
loops are not allowed so edges are only possible
for points inside the convex hull of \code{Yp} points.
