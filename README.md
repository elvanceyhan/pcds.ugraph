This is an R package that contains the functions for construction and visualization of the underlying and reflexivity graphs of the proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) for one, two and three dimensional data. The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice (AS) PCDs, Proportional-Edge (PE) PCDs and Central Similarity (CS) PCDs. The package also contains functions for testing patterns of segregation and association against complete spatial randomness (CSR) and Uniformness of data in one, two, and three dimensional cases using the edge density of these PCD-based graphs. Also included are functions for generating patterns of segregation, association, complete spatial randomness (CSR) and Uniform data in one, two, and three dimensional cases.
